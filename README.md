# HardForkWhitepaper
Preparing for the PoWEth hardfork.

**Mainnet Release**
- Mainnet start at 2018.03.31. 16:00 GMT+1!

**HardFork conditions**
- PoWEth were designed to reach a high difficulty level, which will adjusted at some point so high that PoW will stay only as a theoretical option to create new blocks. Fortunately/Unfortunately PoWEth were way more overmined that we ever expected, it caused the difficulty setted up 4.2e+65 (higher number than atoms exist in the universe) after the 3rd difficulty adjustement.

We learned many lessons from this and the days since the start, how PoWEth can be a better Token. Since Ethereum SmartContrats are made for livelong cycle, to modify anything only possible if we call a HardFork. HardFork were planned in 2018 Q3, but in this situation we should bring the deadline closer.
Every PoWEth owner will get equal amount of PoWAdv(enced). In PoWAdv we will implement a new way to adjust difficulty and make us more green while we still PoW and without creating unnecessary implementation such masterdones or interest.

**PoWEth -> PoWAdv**
- Within the HardFork the New Contract will send out same amount of PoWAdv token to every PoWEth owner.

**PoW conception should stay:**
- Proof of work were given us from Satoshi Nakamoto. We should accept that PoW is the best way to rewarding peoples for their thurst and hard work.
However, his vision were that 1 million people will do the work with 1 CPU, not 1 people with 1 million CPU. We should find the the balance in rewarding peoples thrust and eliminate the advantages of unlimited computation resources.

**Distribution method**
- Does Bitcoin,Ethereum,Zcash distributed equaly? Until some point, yes or maybe. But it was designed to keep users mining until "forever" which will power the network.

In PoWAdv where we use PoW only for distribution, we don't need to force peoples to mining forever or buy more and more computation power. 
Our solid changes in the mining:
1. Block rewards became constant 250/Block , this will cause a few year long process until the distribution ended. If we will forge a Block every 1/10 hour, 240 Block /day -> 60.000 Token / Day -> ~ 1666 Day until the 100.000.000 became available.
2. Token holding instead of pay Hardware/Electricity, mining should be available to everyone even with a single CPU. In PoWAdv the required difficulty will be divided by your Token steak. Required difficulty = Inherent diff / Miner Steake.
This will make Pools or Mining farms less effective until the block miners are keep their stakes.

*Hint, true equal distribution **and** create value by forging blocks cannot be possible.*
